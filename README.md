A Data-Driven Approach to Assessing Car Ownership and Income Impact on Healthcare Access in Underserved Regions.

## Project title: Barriers to Health Access: Exploring the Role of Income and Car Ownership in Underserved Communities 
#### Project description: 
Accessibility to health care facilities and inequalities due to different socio-economic factors is a vast topic to study. Many studies have been conducted to identify the determinants that limit peopleâ€™s ability to access services. Accessibility can be defined using five key dimensions: availability, accessibility, affordability, acceptability, and accommodation. In different ways, these five key dimensions represent the social determinants and geographic barriers of access. There are lot of social and geographic determinants contribute to the barriers of health care accessibility such as race/ethnicity, gender,rural/urban residence, housing status, education, income, occupation, employment status,transportation infrastructure, and the physical and built environment, collectively contribute to health inequalities. While many factors contribute to this issue, this study focuses solely on income and transportation options (e.g., public transit availability and car ownership).
